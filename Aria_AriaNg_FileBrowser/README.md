```yaml
version: "3.5"
services:
  aria2-ui:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: wahyd4/aria2-ui:latest
    environment:
      - ENABLE_AUTH=true
      - ARIA2_USER=hello
      - ARIA2_PWD=world
      - DOMAIN=http://toozhao.com
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```
Then just run `docker-compose up -d`, that's it!

### Supported Environment Variables

  * ENABLE_AUTH whether to enable Basic auth
  * ARIA2_USER Basic Auth username
  * ARIA2_PWD Basic Auth password
  * ARIA2_EXTERNAL_PORT The Aria2 port which exposed to public to access to
  * PUID Bind Linux UID into container which means you can use non `root` user to manage downloaded files, default UID is `1000`
  * PGID Bind Linux GID into container, default GID is 1000
  * RPC_SECRET The Aria2 RPC secret token

  * `/app/conf` The Aria2 configuration and file session folder. Make sure you have `aria2.conf` and `aria2.session` file. For the first time `aria2.session` just need to be a empty file can be appended.

## Auto SSL enabling

Make sure you have add proper `A` record point to the host you running to your domain `DNS` record list, then just add `e` option to bind the `https` domain when you run the image

```bash
docker run -d --name aria2-ui -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -e DOMAIN=https://toozhao.com wahyd4/aria2-ui
```
## Build the image by yourself

```

## Usage it in Docker compose

  Please refer <https://github.com/wahyd4/aria2-ariang-x-docker-compose>

## FAQ
  1. When you running the docker image with non `80` port or you have HTTPS enabled, you will meet the error says `Aria2 Status Disconnected`, then you will need to set `ARIA2_EXTERNAL_PORT` and recreate your container.
  2. If there is no speed at all when you downloading a BitTorrent file, please try to use a popular torrent file first to help the application to cache `DHT` file. Then the speed should get fast and fast, as well as downloading other links.
  3. If you see any errors related to `setcap` which probably means the Linux you are running doesn't support running this application with `non-root` user. So please specify the `PUID` and `PGID` to `0` explicitly to use `root` user to run it.
